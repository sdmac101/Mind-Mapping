ON THE EVE OF REVOLUTION The decade from 1763 to 1774 was a difficult one for the British Empire. In the colonies, Patriot groups like the Sons of Liberty led boycotts of British goods and took violent measures that stymied British officials. Boston proved to be the epicenter of protest. When the Massachusetts Assembly refused to pay for the tea, Parliament enacted a series of laws called the Coercive Acts, which some colonists called the Intolerable Acts. In September and October 1774, all the colonies except Georgia participated in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia advocated a boycott of all British goods and established the Continental Association to enforce local adherence to a boycott of all British goods. the Continental Association supplanted royal control and shaped resistance to Great Britain. In an effort to restore law and order in Boston, the British dispatched General Thomas Gage to the New England seaport. Suffolk Suffolk Resolves signaled the overthrow of the royal government in Massachusetts.
