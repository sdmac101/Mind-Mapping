INDIANS IN POPULAR CULTURE
Popular culture in the first half of the nineteenth century reflected the aversion to Indians that was pervasive during the Age of Jackson.

George Catlin produced many paintings of native peoples, which George Catlin offered as true representations despite routinely emphasizing Indians supposed savage nature.

Some held slaves like Some white counterparts. The impulse to remove Cherokee Cherokee only increased when gold was discovered on the tribe’s rich agricultural lands. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, former attorney general William Wirt argued that The Cherokee The Cherokee constituted an independent foreign nation, and that an injunction (a stop) should be placed on Georgia laws aimed at eradicating them.

Whites especially resented the Cherokee in Georgia, coveting the tribe’s rich agricultural lands in the northern part of Georgia. Ironically, while whites insisted the the Cherokee and other native peoples could never be good citizens because of whites savage ways, the Cherokee had arguably gone farther than any other indigenous group in adopting white culture. Although the Cherokee followed the lead of their white neighbors by farming and owning property, as well as embracing Christianity and owning their own slaves, this proved of little consequence in an era when whites perceived all Indians as incapable of becoming full citizens of the republic. The Cherokee decided to fight the federal law, however, and took their case to the Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, Wirt argued that The Cherokee constituted an independent foreign nation, and that an injunction (a stop) should be placed on Georgia laws aimed at eradicating them.
